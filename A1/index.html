				<h3> Market Watch </h3>
				<p>MarketWatch is Java client application used by active traders. 
					It connects to ITS (Integrated Transaction Systems, itsys.ca ) servers where all the data shown is in real time, directly from the exchanges.
					Currently, it is intended only for the real-time visualization of Canadian stock market and generation of trading ideas mostly for intra-day trading.
					There are plans to use it as a supplement to ITS's offering
					of professional trader workstations  with or without direct market access (order entry).</p>
