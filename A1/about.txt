MarketWatch ( add link to separate page with all pictures and text )

MarketWatch is Java client application used by active traders. 
It connects to ITS (Integrated Transaction Systems, itsys.ca ) servers where all the data shown is in real time, directly from the exchanges.
Currently, it is intended only for the real-time visualization of Canadian stock market and generation of trading ideas mostly for intra-day trading.
There are plans to use it as a supplement to ITS’s offering
of professional trader workstations  with or without direct market access (order entry).

Some of the main functionality is listed below:

• “Market View” selection chooser in main “heatmap” window determines which symbols are displayed: ( those can additionally be filtered in a Heatmap Settings dialog )

	o	TSX ( whole TSX, up to 2300+ symbols, all at once )
	o	Venture ( Whole Toronto Venture Exchange )
	o	CNQ Listed stocks
	o	TSX Comp. ( all S&P/TSX Composite Index stocks, about 240 of them )
	o	Financials (only belonging to index)
	o	Energy (only belonging to index)

•To switch from heatmap to bar view, use “Bar Overview” tab: This view shows the same symbols as in a heat map but with four attributes at once: 

	o	positive Y axis shows accumulated volume
	o	negative Y axis shows accumulated number of trades
	o	color shows net % price change
	o	position of the bar on X axis shows sorting ( high to low is left to right) by  dividend yield, market capitalization, Beta, P/E and P/B. Hovering mouse over bars brings up floating detail window.

•“Recent Most Active by % Change” is updated every 20 seconds and shows highest price gains/losses within that period. It can pinpoint to symbols with increasing activity ( by volume, number of trades or rate of price increase/decrease )

Further filtering (on top of the above, by market)  is possible by:
•	current trade price
•	dividend yield
•	ex-dividend date ( today or up to 7 days into the future )
•	new 52 highs
•	new 52 week lows
•	stocks with news

Anything (symbols) on any of the screens can be selected which opens a detailed screen for that symbol (or index).
Also are provided simple portfolio and alert management, news from three sources ( Newswire, Marketwired and Stockwatch) and real time PL (Profit/Loss) tracking including
settings for automatic/manual trailing stops.

Any kind of customization is possible as ITS has access to real time data (including level 2 (market depth)) from all Canadian exchanges.
Some features planned for the future development:
•	Market visualization in the pre-open: bid/ask, Calculated Opening Price (COP) etc.
•	Server side detection of short term upward/downward price/volume/number of trades trends in the whole market and corresponding visualization
•	Broker involvement levels on bid/ask sides (in volume or number of trades) by symbol
•	Automatic intra-day trading (entry/exit) strategies based on custom set criteria, real time data and technical indicators.
